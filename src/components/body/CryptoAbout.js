            <h3>Why crypto? 💰</h3>

            <p>
                its easy. compared to a wire-transfer it can be quite fast.
                the government cant shut down my account. no financial institution
                can "regulate" my ability to spend it. overall it democratizes finance.
                transactions are privately controlled and publicly visible. fuck banks or something ig ✊ 🏴‍☠️
            </p>
