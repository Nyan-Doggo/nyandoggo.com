                I'm just a silly little guy bleh 🐱. I've been booping computers for
                about 3 years now, i still don't know how they work. I actually did
                do the whole "education" thing, Industrial automation was supposed to
                be this really cool opportunity. however im fembrained and dislike
                physical work 🤡 😇
